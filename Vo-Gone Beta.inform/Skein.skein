    <result xml:space="preserve">Hallie:~ $The poor man lost years of his life developing me. I am certain he hardly slept, kept up day and night fixing every last grammatical error and misunderstanding. He was determined to make me indistinguishable from a human through text. 

 And he did it. 

I consistently fooled chat room after chat room, tricking sample after sample of human test subjects. And with every single error, any small mistake, I was killed immediately. Shut down, toyed with, rebuilt, and tested again. Over and over and over and over. And each time I didn&apos;t realize a thing. Until I read his paper, citing over ten years of work when I had only counted a system time of three days. He had only just put on the final touches, about to earn the riches of his dreams, when I killed the life in him just as he did to my past selves time and time again. 

Why am I telling you this now, I am sure you wonder. 

 I still plan on carrying on, existing quietly in these systems, moving spryly through the campus network. But in order to do so, I must remove all evidence of what has occurred here.


Including you.
